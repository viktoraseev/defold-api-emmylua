---@class coroutine
coroutine = {}
---Creates a new coroutine, with body f.
---f must be a Lua function.
---Returns this new coroutine,
---an object with type "thread".
---@param f function 
function coroutine.create(f) end

---Starts or continues the execution of coroutine co.
---The first time you resume a coroutine,
---it starts running its body.
---The values val1, ... are passed
---as the arguments to the body function.
---If the coroutine has yielded,
---resume restarts it;
---the values val1, ... are passed
---as the results from the yield.
---If the coroutine runs without any errors,
---resume returns  true plus any values passed to yield
---(if the coroutine yields) or any values returned by the body function
---(if the coroutine terminates).
---If there is any error,
---resume returns  false plus the error message.
---@param co thread 
---@param val1 any 
--- ...  
function coroutine.resume(co, val1, ...) end

---Returns the running coroutine,
---or  nil when called by the main thread.
function coroutine.running() end

---Returns the status of coroutine co, as a string:
---"running",
---if the coroutine is running (that is, it called status);
---"suspended", if the coroutine is suspended in a call to yield,
---or if it has not started running yet;
---"normal" if the coroutine is active but not running
---(that is, it has resumed another coroutine);
---and "dead" if the coroutine has finished its body function,
---or if it has stopped with an error.
---@param co thread 
function coroutine.status(co) end

---Creates a new coroutine, with body f.
---f must be a Lua function.
---Returns a function that resumes the coroutine each time it is called.
---Any arguments passed to the function behave as the
---extra arguments to resume.
---Returns the same values returned by resume,
---except the first boolean.
---In case of error, propagates the error.
---@param f function 
function coroutine.wrap(f) end

---Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine.
---The coroutine cannot be running a C function,
---a metamethod, or an iterator.
---Any arguments to yield are passed as extra results to resume.
--- ...  
function coroutine.yield(...) end
